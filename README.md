# SmartPowerBackend
This repository contains all the backend and the database scripts required to predict weather conditions, interface with the front end (bi-directionally), and interface
with the required devices based on logic discussed with Dr. Abou Rjeily. This was constructed using an MVC framework, we modeled Loads, Sources, StatusUpdates,
WifiSwitches, Schedules, and TrackerClasses. Our controllers interface with the given models and make the necessary API calls and manipulate the loads based on our
schedules.
